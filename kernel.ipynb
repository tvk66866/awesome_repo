United States Medicare is funded by a payroll tax, premiums and surtaxes from beneficiaries, and general revenue. It provides health insurance for Americans aged 65 and older who have worked and paid into the system through the payroll tax. It also provides health insurance to younger people with some disability status as determined by the Social Security Administration, as well as people with end stage renal disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.\n\nIn 2015, Medicare provided health insurance for over **55 million** (46 million people age 65 and older and 9 million younger people). On average, Medicare covers about half of the health care charges for those enrolled. The enrollees must then cover their remaining costs either with supplemental insurance, separate insurance, or out-of-pocket. Out-of-pocket costs can vary depending on the amount of health care a Medicare enrollee needs. \n\n## About CMS\n\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), previously known as the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), is a federal agency within the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that administers the Medicare program and works in partnership with state governments to administer Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and health insurance portability standards. In addition to these programs, CMS has other responsibilities, including the administrative simplification standards from the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), quality standards in long-term care facilities (more commonly referred to as nursing homes) through its survey and certification process, clinical laboratory quality standards under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, and oversight of HealthCare.gov.\n\n## About the Data-Set\n\nThis [public dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/cms/cms-medicare) was created by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. The data summarizes the utilization and payments for procedures, services, and prescription drugs provided to Medicare beneficiaries by specific inpatient and outpatient hospitals, physicians, and other suppliers. The dataset includes the following data: Common inpatient and outpatient services, All physician and other supplier procedures and services, All Part D prescriptions. Providers determine what they will charge for items, services, and procedures provided to patients and these charges are the amount that providers bill for an item, service, or procedure.\n\nIn this notebook, I have explored the complete dataset using BigQuery, performed clustering on nursing facilities data to identify groups of nursing facilities having similar characteristics\n\n## Contents\n\n1.

Which State (and Nursing Facilities) have poor HCC risk adjustment scores \n\nThe Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) uses a Hierarchical Condition Category (HCC) risk adjustment model to calculate risk scores. The HCC model ranks diagnoses into categories that represent conditions with similar cost patterns. Higher categories represent higher predicted healthcare costs, resulting in higher risk scores. CMS uses HCCs to reimburse Medicare Advantage plans based on the health of their members. It pays accurately for the predicted cost expenditures of patients by adjusting those payments based on demographic information and patient health status. The risk assessment data used is based on the diagnosis information pulled from claims and medical records which are collected by physician offices, hospital inpatient visits and in outpatient settings.\n\nCMS states that higher HCC scores means there is higher risk of chronic diseases while lower hcc indicates healthy population. It will be interesting to see what is the average hcc score for different states and facilities. \n\n\n### 2.1 Max and Min HCCs for different states\n"

This will help to identify the Nursing Facilities having similar behaviours / characteristics. Before Running Clustering I have applied data Preprocessing which includes Removing textual columns and dropping the missing Values\n\nReference - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering"

All of these values are lowest when compared to values for Nursing Facilities in Group B, C, and D. \n> - The White Beneficiary distribution of this group is scattered over to lower side with the mean of the normal curve equal to about 50. While the Black beneficiary distribution of this group contains very less data. Does this indicate that the nursing facilities in this group (almost) always serve to White Population? Maybe Yes ! \n> - Similar distribution behaviour is shown by the variables - total stays and distinct beneficiaries per providers\n\n**Characteristics of Nursing Facilities in Group B**    \n> - Group B is one of those group in which the HCC risk value is on the higher side (average = 2.40) \n> - The White population beneficiaries of this group are scattered normally pivoted at 220-239 while black population beneficiaries is much higher than group A but it still on the lower side \n\n**Characteristics of Nursing Facilities in Group C**    \n> - Group C is the one in which mean HCC value is not that higher but mean value of Total Skilled Nursing Facility Charge (9.1 M), Medicare Payment (16.1 M), and the number of distinct beneficiaries (580) is the highest among any other groups. \n> - There is less variability in the number of black beneficiaries  and it follows a pretty standard set of values \n\n**Characteristics of Nursing Facilities in Group D**    \n> - In Group D, the average HCC score of Nursing Facilities is the highest than any other group equal to 2.45  \n\n### Thanks for Viewing the Kernel"
